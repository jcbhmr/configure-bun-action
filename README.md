## Usage

```yml

```

### Limitations

- You need an internet connection to fetch the latest available version of Bun. This can take time or fail completely.

- You need to actually _use this jcbhmr/configure-bun-action action_ and it's not as simple as native Node.js. Then again, Node.js still often requires a bundling step so it's your choice where to put the complexity.
